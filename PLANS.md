# PLANS.md — Sovereign AI Project State

**Last updated**: Post-Plan 74 (2026-06-25)

This document tracks the dynamic state of the Sovereign AI project: baselines, completed prompts, and the next-5-prompt queue. It is the canonical source for test counts, static analysis baselines, and which prompt is currently active.

---

## Test Baseline

**Current baseline**: **1308 passed, 67 skipped**
**Verified**: Plan 74.5, Step S6 (full test suite with coverage)
**Tolerance**: ±5 tests (variance acceptable due to parameterized fixtures and environment variation)
**Delta tracking**: If S1 test count differs from baseline, update this entry + note in CHANGELOG.

---

## Static Analysis Baseline

**Captured**: Plan 71 (tooling integration — 2026-06-24)

| Tool | Baseline | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ruff** | 0 errors | Plan 60 S2 | No errors. Plan 59 cleanup fully held. |
| **Mypy (core/system)** | 0 errors | Plan 66 S3 | Delta: -294 from Plan 60 baseline (294 → 0). Core and system directories fully clean. |
| **Mypy (full-repo)** | 0 errors | Plan 67 S6 | Delta: -294 from Plan 60 baseline (294 → 0). Full remediation of adapters, CLI, memory, workers, skills, tests, scripts (181 source files). |
| **Bandit** | 3,384 low, 1 medium, 0 high | Plan 70 S4 | Delta: +205 low, +1 medium from Plan 60 baseline. New B608 finding in memory/postgres_trace_store.py:161 (false positive - asyncpg parameterized query). |
| **pip-audit** | 19 CVEs across 4 packages | Plan 70 S5 | Stable across Plans 56-70. No actionable fixes (upstream only). |
| **Vulture** | 23 high-confidence findings | Plan 70 S6 | Stable across Plans 60-70. Dead code analysis only. |
| **detect-secrets** | 15 findings (baseline) | Plan 71 S9 | Baseline established with .secrets.baseline. All findings are false positives (test fixtures, doc examples). |
| **pre-commit** | Configured | Plan 74 S2 | Hooks installed: trailing-whitespace, end-of-file-fixer, check-yaml, check-json, check-toml, black, ruff, isort, detect-secrets. Mypy hook removed (stall prevention — follows imports into out-of-scope files). |
| **pytest-cov** | Configured | Plan 71 S11 | Coverage reports: term-missing + HTML. No fail threshold (baseline: 1% coverage). |
| **Coverage** | 82% (24,664 statements, 4,359 missing) | Plan 71 S16 | Informational only — does NOT gate CI. Baseline captured at Plan 71. Trend: should not drop >5% in future plans — document any drops in reconciliation notes. |

**Per-plan verification cadence**:
- **Every plan**: Ruff (file-scoped) + Mypy (file-scoped) + Pytest
- **Every 5th plan** (55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80): Full scan (all 6 tools + pytest)
- **Security-sensitive plans**: Add bandit
- **Dependency-touching plans**: Add pip-audit
- **Docs-only plans**: Skip ruff, mypy (no code); test count + tag + push verification only

## Baseline Reconciliation Notes

- **Test count delta**: 1253 → 1257 (+4) at Plan 71 (AR18 compliance test). 1257 → 1257 (no change) at Plan 72 (no tests added). 1257 → 1269 (+12) at Plan 73 (sandbox tests + skill test updates). 1269 → 1289 (+20) at Plan 74 (cost tracker tests + orchestrator/resource_budget test updates). 1289 → 1308 (+19) at Plan 74.5 (17 PrismLlamaAdapter tests + 2 adapter_factory tests). Baseline updated to 1308 passed, 67 skipped. Within ±5 tolerance (actual +19, all new tests are in-scope).
- **Mypy delta**: 0 → 0 (no change) at Plan 71. 0 → 0 (no change) at Plan 72. 0 → 0 (no change) at Plan 73. 0 → 0 (no change) at Plan 74 (file-scoped mypy on new files, all clean). Baseline holds at 0 errors.
- **Ruff delta**: 0 → 0 (no change) at Plan 71. 0 → 0 (no change) at Plan 72. 0 → 0 (no change) at Plan 73. 0 → 0 (no change) at Plan 74 (black/isort auto-fixed during pre-commit). Baseline holds at 0 errors.
- **Bandit delta**: No change at Plan 71-73. No change at Plan 74 (no security-sensitive code added).
- **pip-audit delta**: No change at Plan 71-73. No change at Plan 74 (no dependency changes).
- **Vulture delta**: No change at Plan 71-73. No change at Plan 74 (no new dead code; 23 findings remain in whitelist).
- **detect-secrets**: Baseline established at Plan 71 with 15 findings (all false positives). No change at Plan 72-74.
- **pre-commit**: Configured at Plan 71 with 10 hooks. Mypy hook removed at Plan 74 (stall prevention — follows imports into out-of-scope files, causing Plan 73 stall).
- **pytest-cov**: Configured at Plan 71 with term-missing and HTML reports. Coverage baseline captured at Plan 71: 82% (24,664 statements, 4,359 missing). No change at Plan 72-74 (coverage held at 82%). Coverage increased to 83% at Plan 74.5 (25,626 statements, 4,476 missing) due to new adapter tests.
- **Plan 71 scope violation**: Plan 71's checkpoint commit (72e2aa6) bundled 10 GLM Prompts/ plan files into the prompt-71 tag, violating OR26. Plan 72 documented this violation and enforced the going-forward pattern via OR32 and workflow doc updates.
- **Plan 73 stall**: Plan 73 stalled due to mypy hook following imports into out-of-scope files (core/task_state_machine.py). Plan 74 removed mypy from pre-commit (stall prevention) and added OR33 (no hook exclusions per L12).

## Research-Backed Feature Roadmap (Plan 67+)

Source: Analysis of 5 GitHub projects (DeerFlow 2.0, codebase-memory-mcp, mattpocock/skills, g-stack, hermes-agent). 16 replicable features identified, organized by integration phase.

### Phase 1 — Foundation (Plans 71–74, after Plan 70 milestone scan complete)

These features are high-impact, high-feasibility, and require minimal architectural changes:

| # | Feature | Source | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | **Skill taxonomy** | mattpocock/skills | Classify skills as user-invoked (CLI triggers) vs agent-invoked (automatic). Enables skill discovery, routing, and permission scoping. |
| F2 | **CONTEXT.md shared language** | mattpocock/skills | Project-level CONTEXT.md file defining domain terms, conventions, and shared vocabulary. Reduces ambiguity in multi-agent coordination. |
| F3 | **Persist-nudge memory** | DeerFlow 2.0 | Persistent memory store with nudge-based retrieval. Agents store observations and are nudged when relevant context surfaces. Lightweight alternative to full RAG. |
| F4 | **Trust tier system** | g-stack | Three-tier trust model (trusted internal / semi-trusted external / untrusted user input) with graduated validation and sandboxing. Strengthens prompt injection defense. |

### Phase 2 — Intelligence (Plans 75–78)

These features add code intelligence and learning loops:

| # | Feature | Source | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| F5 | **Code knowledge graph** | codebase-memory-mcp | SQLite-backed knowledge graph with sub-ms queries. Stores symbol definitions, call chains, and dependency edges. Replaces grep-based code search. |
| F6 | **Closed learning loop** | hermes-agent | Automated cycle: execute → evaluate → store → retrieve. Session outcomes feed back into future decisions without manual intervention. |
| F7 | **Session search (FTS5)** | hermes-agent | Full-text search over past session transcripts using SQLite FTS5. Enables "how did I solve X last time?" queries. |
| F8 | **Taste memory with decay** | g-stack | Preference scoring with exponential decay. Recent successes weighted higher than old ones. Prevents stale preference drift. |

### Phase 3 — Orchestration (Plans 79–82)

These features enhance agent coordination and lifecycle management:

| # | Feature | Source | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| F9 | **SuperAgent harness** | DeerFlow 2.0 | Orchestrator that delegates to specialized sub-agents in Docker sandboxes. Isolates execution, enables parallel workstreams. |
| F10 | **Sprint lifecycle pipeline** | g-stack | Structured sprint workflow: backlog → in-progress → review → done. Integrates with plan-based development for status tracking. |
| F11 | **User modeling (Honcho)** | hermes-agent | Per-user behavioral modeling via Honcho. Adapts agent responses and priorities based on user interaction patterns. |
| F12 | **Cron scheduler** | hermes-agent | Built-in cron system for scheduled tasks (health checks, data refresh, periodic evaluations). Replaces external cron dependencies. |

### Phase 4 — Hardening (Plans 83–86)

These features add defense, portability, and resilience:

| # | Feature | Source | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| F13 | **Docker sandbox execution** | DeerFlow 2.0 | Isolate agent code execution in Docker containers. Prevents runaway processes from affecting host. Complements OR28 zombie process prevention. |
| F14 | **Markdown skill definitions** | DeerFlow 2.0 | Skills defined as structured Markdown files (purpose, inputs, outputs, examples). Human-readable, version-controllable, LLM-parseable. |
| F15 | **Prompt injection defense** | g-stack | Multi-layer defense: input sanitization, output filtering, and trust-tier-based validation. Protects against adversarial prompts across trust boundaries. |
| F16 | **Incremental knowledge sync** | codebase-memory-mcp | Watch filesystem for changes and incrementally update the code knowledge graph. Avoids full re-index on every code change. |

### Integration Principles

- **No external dependencies required** — All features implementable with Python stdlib + existing Sovereign AI stack (SQLite, async, etc.).
- **Incremental adoption** — Each feature is self-contained; can be adopted independently without blocking others.
- **Plan-scoped delivery** — Each plan delivers 1–2 features with full test coverage. No big-bang integrations.
- **Baseline preservation** — Every feature plan must pass the same gates: pytest ±5, mypy file-scoped clean, ruff 0 errors.

### Source Projects

| Project | Key Insight |
|---|---|
| **DeerFlow 2.0** | SuperAgent orchestration with Docker isolation + Markdown-defined skills + persistent nudge memory |
| **codebase-memory-mcp** | Sub-ms code intelligence via SQLite knowledge graph + incremental sync |
| **mattpocock/skills** | Clean skill taxonomy (user/agent invocation) + CONTEXT.md shared vocabulary |
| **g-stack** | Sprint lifecycle + taste memory decay + multi-layer prompt injection defense + trust tiers |
| **hermes-agent** | Closed learning loop + FTS5 session search + Honcho user modeling + cron scheduler |

## How to Update This Document

1. **After every plan**: Update "Completed Prompts" table with new row (add to bottom).
2. **At baseline changes**: Update "Test Baseline" or "Static Analysis Baseline" sections with new counts + source.
3. **When shifting queue**: Move active plan to completed table, promote Plan {N+1} to active, add new open slot at bottom.
4. **Status sections**: Update if a feature moved from "Built but not reachable" → "Works right now" or vice versa.
5. **Use Edit tool only** — never PowerShell `-replace` or `Set-Content` on this file (see AGENTS.md rule 23).
